# 2D_array_activity
Code templates and keys for python 2D array lesson. 

These files are meant to be used in combination with the following lesson plan linked here 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R7QSAQzH5zqAbik0lJZNfavdjk6pWai8SKt60PZvi28/edit?usp=sharing

This lesson is in preparation for coding a connect 4 game. 

Students should be given a copy of the file **2D_arrays_part2_template.py** to use for their own
code experimentation.

I recommend instructors download **2D_arrays_part1.py** to demonstrate the outcome of code 
from part one of the assignemnt.

I recommend instructors dowload their own copy of **2D_arrays_part2_template.py** to 
demonstrate possible solutions during discussion.

See **KEY_2D_arrays_part2.py** for some sample solutions to the problems in part 2.
